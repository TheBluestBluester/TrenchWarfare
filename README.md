# TrenchWarfare
Dig trench n fight for flags.

If the minigame and the enviroment are not already setup the plugin will do it automatically.
You can change the enviroment and the minigame in the "Minig and Env" folder.
Make sure when changing that the names match.

You can also add or remove maps in the Map folder.

## Guide to creating maps:
The included minigame uses the default color pallete.

### To make the maps function you have to add interact component with the following in the ConsoleTag:

#### trench
The trench.
You can only have 1 color of trench.
#### redflag
Red team's flag
#### blueflag
Blue team's flag

#### Notes:
Trench cannot be placed on non-trench bricks.

The trench bricks MUST be 2x cubes, 4x cubes, 16x, 32x, 64x, etc.

Due to the way the trench plugin works its limited to a single color.
